# Python Module 

# A python module is a file containing a set of codes or a function which can be included to an application. 
# A module could be a file containing a single variable , a function or a big code base. 

# Simplication 
# Flexibility - Modules are frequently used to establish conceptual seperations between various problem areas. 
# it's less likely that changes in one module would influence other parts of the program if modules are constructed 
# in a fashion that reduces the interconnectedness. 

# Modules are used for reusability purposes. 
#scope - using of functions, modules and packages. 
# A document with definitions of functions and various statements are called as python modules. 
# A module can define functions, classes and variables. 
# A module can also include runnable code, grouping of related code in module makes the code easier to understand and use. 
# it also makes the code to be logically organized. 

import calculator

print("Calculator in Python using Modules: ")
# addition operation
print(calculator.add(10, 4))

# substraction operation 

print(calculator.subs(15, 5))

# multiplication operation 

print(calculator.mul(10, 8))

# division operation
